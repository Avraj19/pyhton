# Functions

Function have one job, becasue it makes it easier to test and understand

# Syntax:
```python
def function_name():
    'block_of_code'
    return 'block_of_code'
```


# How do they work?
definr the function
call the funtion
the block_of_code runs as intended

Other functionalists:
- They can take ing arguments to be dynamic of morph the output

Why functions?
Because it keeps our code dry
Don't
Repeat
Yourself

Allowing us to call said function to do the action instead

## Best prctices of a function
- Naming convention in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
- It does ONE JOB! ONE!
- Separation of concerns

## Basics of a test 
- write the test first 
- 

## Pros:
- Who when and where the code will break (Write a block of code and test it before moving on)  
- Increase understanding of your code 
- Easier to maintain  
- Reduce cost of maintenance  
- Help define when your done  
- Reduces technical depth  

## Cons:
- Time it for test each block of code
