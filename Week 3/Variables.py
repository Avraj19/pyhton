# Simple print
# print('Hello World')


# name = 'Avraj'
# print(name)


# print(type(name))

# age = 1
# name = 'new born'
# name_age = name + age
#
# print(name_age)

# favorite_color = 'Blue'
# best_team = 'Not Arsenal'

# You can ask the user to input data and save it in a variable
# first_name = input('What is your name?')
# print(first_name)

# cust_name = input('What is your full name? \n')
# cust_age = int(input('What is your age? \n'))
# cust_dob = input('What is your date of birth? \n')
# print(type(cust_name, cust_dob, cust_age))

# # who is older age or new_age
# age = 23
# new_age = 24.6
# # In this case we used the greater than symbol
# # This is a boolean and it will return a true or false
# print(new_age > age)
#
# # Another way is using a if statement
# # This will print out which ever number is greater
# if age < new_age:
